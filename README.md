# Swansea University CompSci LaTeX Template

This template is provided for Swansea University CompSci students (and others elsewhere too) as a very simple LaTeX framework for the creation of reports or other such academic literature.

You can either fork or clone (and [change the remote](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/managing-remote-repositories#changing-a-remote-repositorys-url)) this repository, and use it to start your report off! The current PDF version of this document [can be found here](https://merchygoedwig.gitlab.io/swansea-university-compsci-latex-template/report.pdf) (it will be updated by GitLab CI/CD each time a new push is made to `master`).

Use of this report template is subject to the terms of the [Educational Community License, Version 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/ECL-2.0), for which an excellent summary is [given by GitHub](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ecl-2.0/). While you are free to use the template as per the licence, you may be required to acknowledge this use (from an academic integrity standpoint) within your report, speak to your supervisor for guidance.
