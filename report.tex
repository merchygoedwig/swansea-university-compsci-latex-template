% GENERAL SETTINGS
\graphicspath{{./figs/}} % Sets graphic path to `/figs` folder
\setlength\parindent{0cm} % Removes indent at start of paragraph
\setlength\arrayrulewidth{1pt} % Table seperators are wider


\begin{document}
% PREAMBLE
% Layout of document proper, content stored in individual files which are "imported" using `\include{}` or `\import{}`

\pagenumbering{gobble}
\include{frontmatter/titlepage}

% Remove these as appropriate
\include{frontmatter/abstract}
\include{frontmatter/declarations}
\include{frontmatter/acknowledgements}

\pagenumbering{roman} % Front matter to have seperate page-numbering scheme from rest of report

\tableofcontents

\newpage % Fixes page numbering issue (so next page starts at 1 instead of 2)

\setlength\arrayrulewidth{0.5pt} % Reset tabular appearance for rest of report
\pagenumbering{arabic}

% START OF REPORT
% Start of report proper, either use above system of imports or write here. While the latter is simpler for beginners, it presents difficulties for management of content for reports larger than 10 pages.
